            "GitHub repository and detailed README: https://github.com/Xiaomony/NoitaSaveManager\nImportant Notes:\n    1. This program creates an \"Saves\" folder in its directory to store log files and saves. Do not delete this folder (deleting it will reset the program to its initial state)\n    2. It is recommended to place the program in a folder on your disk and create a desktop shortcut (to avoid accidental deletion of the Save folder created on the desktop)\n    3. Load saves only when the \"Continue\" option is available on the Noita main menu. If not, start a \"New Game\", then close the game and load the save, reopening it and clicking \"Continue\"\n    4. It is recommended to disable Steam Cloud saves\n    5. Only save when Noita has been properly saved and closed\n        (Saving during gameplay will save Noita's auto-save, which may be from several minutes ago, not the current state)\n    6. Do not load saves during gameplay\n    7. As the game progresses, the time and space required for each save will increase significantly. Please be patient\n    8. The command-line version of this program supports command-line arguments\n    9. The command-line and GUI versions can share the same Saves folder, but never run both versions simultaneously\n    10. Launching Noita through this program is faster than via Steam, but you must first set the path to noita.exe using the appropriate command\n    11. If Steam is not running when you launch Noita through this program, Steam mods and cloud saves will not be loaded\n    12. To find the Noita path: In your Steam library, go to Noita → click the gear icon → Manage → Browse local files"
